# KranSMP
A open-source copy of KranSMP. Passwords are hashed, and this will be updated on every major/minor change to KranSMP.

# Why?
Because. Also we believe that everyone should have a starting point for developing their own server.

# Possible Concerns
- **Is player data safe?** All passwords for login are hashed, and usernames aren't very risky to upload online.
-  **What's stopping fake servers from existing if the main server is open-source?** The official Discord server is [this one](https://discord.com/invite/rwzuhUDymB). The official IP can be obtained by being a accepted member in the official Discord.
